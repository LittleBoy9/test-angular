    Facebook is a social media platform that was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in
    2004. It is one of the largest social networking sites in the world, with
    over 2.9 billion monthly active users as of 2021. Facebook allows users to
    create a personal profile, connect with friends and family, share photos and
    videos, join groups and events, and participate in various online
    communities. In addition to its social networking features, Facebook has
    also become a significant player in the digital advertising industry, with
    businesses and marketers using the platform to reach targeted audiences with
    their products and services. Over the years, Facebook has faced various
    controversies regarding its handling of user data and privacy, but it
    remains a popular and influential platform for social connections and online
    communication.

    A galaxy is a vast system of stars, dust, gas, and dark matter held together
    by gravity. There are billions of galaxies in the universe, each containing
    billions of stars, and they come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The
    Milky Way, our own galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy, with a central bar and
    two major spiral arms. Some galaxies, such as elliptical galaxies, have a
    more rounded shape, while others, like irregular galaxies, have no
    particular shape at all. Galaxies also contain many types of celestial
    objects, including planets, asteroids, comets, and black holes. The study of
    galaxies is an essential part of astronomy, as they provide clues about the
    evolution of the universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
    Galaxies also play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of stars,
    as they provide the raw materials for star formation and influence the
    motion of stars within them. The study of galaxies has come a long way since
    the invention of the telescope, and with advances in technology, we continue
    to learn more about the complex systems that make up the universe.

    Earth is the third planet from the sun. It is the only known planet with
    life. It has a diameter of 12,742 km. It has a mass of 5.97 Ã— 10^24 kg.
    Earth's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen. The Earth's atmosphere also contains
    other gases like nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon. The Earth's atmosphere
    protects us from harmful radiation from the sun. Earth's rotation causes day
    and night. Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. The Earth's axis is
    tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. The Earth's rotation axis causes the
    seasons. Earth has one natural satellite, the moon. The moon is about
    one-quarter the size of Earth. The moon's gravity causes tides on Earth.
    Earth is about 4.54 billion years old. The Earth's surface is about 71%
    water and 29% land. The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, which is
    8,848 meters tall. The lowest point on Earth is the Mariana Trench, which is
    11,034 meters deep. Earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates. Earthquakes
    occur when these tectonic plates shift. Volcanoes are also a result of
    tectonic activity. The Earth's core is made up of iron and nickel. The core
    is responsible for the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field
    protects us from harmful solar wind. The Earth's magnetic field also causes
    the Northern and Southern Lights. The Earth's magnetic field is weakening
    over time. The ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere protects us from harmful UV
    radiation. The ozone layer is thinning due to human activity. Earth's
    climate is changing due to human activity. Global warming is causing the
    polar ice caps to melt. Climate change is causing more severe weather events
    like hurricanes and wildfires. The Earth's biodiversity is declining due to
    human activity. Many species are going extinct due to habitat loss and
    pollution.
