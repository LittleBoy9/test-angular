    Rabindranath Tagore was a renowned Bengali poet, philosopher, musician, and
    polymath who is considered one of the greatest literary figures in Indian
    history. He was the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in
    1913 for his collection of poems, Gitanjali. Tagore was a prolific writer
    who produced works in a variety of genres, including poetry, songs, plays,
    and essays, and he was also an accomplished painter. He was an advocate of
    Indian nationalism and contributed significantly to the Indian independence
    movement through his writings and political activism. His works continue to
    be celebrated for their lyrical beauty, philosophical depth, and social
    commentary. 
    Tagore's legacy has had a lasting impact on Indian literature
    and culture, and his birthday, May 9th, is celebrated as Rabindra Jayanti in
    India. Rabindranath Tagore FRAS was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet,
    writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and
    painter.[4][5][6] He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian
    art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
    Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of
    Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first
    lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were
    viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical
    poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.[9] He was a fellow of the
    Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal",[10][5][6] Tagore
    was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.[a] A Bengali Brahmin
    from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and
    Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of
    sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym
    Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as
    long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and
    dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist,
    internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the
    British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the
    Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings,
    sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his
    legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.[16][17]
    Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and
    resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas,
    and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song
    Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are
    his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were
    acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and
    unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as
    national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar
    Bangla". 
    The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.[18] The
    Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted
    the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and
    Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited
    several professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and teach Indian
    classical music to the children Rabindranath Tagore, also known as Gurudev,
    was a renowned Indian poet, writer, philosopher, musician, and painter. He
    was born on May 7, 1861, in Kolkata, India, and was the youngest son of
    Debendranath Tagore, a prominent figure in the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and
    social reform movement in 19th century Bengal. Tagore received his education
    at home, where he was exposed to a wide range of subjects including
    literature, music, and art. Tagore is considered to be one of the most
    significant literary figures of the 20th century, and his contributions to
    Bengali and Indian literature are immense. He was the first non-European to
    win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems,
    Gitanjali (Song Offerings). The poems in Gitanjali are deeply spiritual and
    reflect Tagore's belief in the unity of all religions. Tagore was also a
    prolific writer of novels, short stories, and plays. Some of his most famous
    works include The Home and the World, Ghare-Baire, and Chokher Bali. His
    plays, such as The Post Office and The King of the Dark Chamber, are still
    performed in India today. Tagore's works often dealt with themes of social
    and political reform, and he was a strong advocate for Indian independence.
    In addition to his literary contributions, Tagore was also a talented
    musician and painter. He composed over 2,000 songs, which are known as
    Rabindra Sangeet, and are still popular in India and Bangladesh. Tagore's
    paintings, which he began creating in his later years, were also highly
    regarded. Tagore's legacy continues to influence Bengali and Indian culture
    to this day. His works have been translated into numerous languages, and his
    ideas on education and social reform are still studied and debated. Tagore's
    belief in the power of art and literature to promote understanding and unity
    between different cultures and religions continues to inspire people around
    the world.
