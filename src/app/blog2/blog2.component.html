      Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He was born in Calcutta, India in 1863 and founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Vivekananda's teachings emphasized the unity of all religions, and he spoke about the importance of self-realization, meditation, and service to humanity. He was a great orator and delivered several powerful speeches, including his famous address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, which brought him international recognition. Rabindranath Tagore, on the other hand, was a renowned Indian poet, philosopher, and Nobel laureate. He was the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, and his works are known for their poetic beauty and philosophical depth. Tagore was also a social reformer who worked towards education for all and the promotion of Indian art and culture. While both Vivekananda and Tagore were influential figures in Indian history, they had different areas of focus and contributed to Indian society in their unique ways.
