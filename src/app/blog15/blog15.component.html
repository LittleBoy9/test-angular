    Chandra Bose was born on 23rd January 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa, India. His
    father, Janakinath Bose, was a prominent lawyer, and his mother, Prabhavati
    Devi, was a devout and religious woman. Netaji was the ninth child in a
    family of fourteen children. He was a bright student and completed his
    education from the University of Calcutta. In 1921, he joined the Indian
